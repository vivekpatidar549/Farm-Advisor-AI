# CropAdvisor: Intelligent Farming Assistance

FarmAdvisor is a machine learning and deep learning-based web application designed to provide comprehensive recommendations for crop selection, fertilizer usage, and identification of potential crop diseases. This tool is aimed at assisting farmers in making informed decisions to optimize their agricultural practices.

## Features

### 1. Crop Recommendation
FarmAdvisor utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors such as soil type, climate conditions, and historical crop performance to recommend the most suitable crops for cultivation. This helps farmers make informed decisions about the crops that are likely to thrive in their specific environment.

### 2. Fertilizer Recommendations
The application provides personalized fertilizer recommendations based on the chosen crop and the characteristics of the soil. By considering nutrient requirements and soil composition, CropAdvisor suggests optimal fertilizers to enhance crop yield and health.
